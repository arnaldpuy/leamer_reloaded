## Abstract

*We look at the issue of "analytic flexibility", rediscovered in the context of recent multi-analyst studies, which motivates a growing interest in the so-called multiverse analysis. After reviewing some multi-analyst and multiverse studies, we suggest that both would greatly benefit from adopting some of the tools developed by global sensitivity analysis ($GSA$) over the last four decades. While both multiverse and GSA share a common ideal reference to the work of Leamer, who suggested something he called GSA to test the robustness of a quantitative inference, and share substantially the same logical sequence of analytic steps, the difference between the two approaches is still significant and motivates the present work. Specifically, GSA offers procedures for efficient exploration of the multidimensional space scanned by the modeling choices, allowing the thus far unexplained "universe of uncertainty" hidden in multi-analyst studies to be unveiled (uncertainty quantification) and characterized (sensitivity analysis). Extending the present multiverse to the older universe of GSA would greatly enrich the analytic capacity of the former and offer the latter a new, exciting area of research. The hidden uncertainty is seen as arising from interaction effects, which are easily detected when the output is examined in the context of a variance-based GSA. We describe analogies and differences between the multiverse and GSA, and illustrate their application to a recent multi-analyst study from Breznau et al.*
